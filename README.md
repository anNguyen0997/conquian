# "Team Rocket" 🚀 Card Games

This app is our DigitalCrafts capstone project, showcasing our creativity and the technologies we have learned from our 16-weeks coding journey.

Our app currently features a multiplayer playing cards game called "[Conquian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquian)". The goal of the game is to work your cards into melds of sets and sequences to win this game! 

## Inspiration 💡

Our team wanted to create a game together and the first thing that came to an agreement was online browser playing card games.
We inititally thought of creating [Tiến Lên](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti%E1%BA%BFn_l%C3%AAn), a classic Vietnamese card games,
but after deliberating, we felt the task was too complex to complete in a week time. We decided to start with Conquian and consider later 
if we can add Tiến Lên when time permit.
